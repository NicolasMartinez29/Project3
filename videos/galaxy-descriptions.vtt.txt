The screen shows an image of deep space, with many stars scattered in all directions.

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.000
As the camera moves forward, we see a large spiral galaxy with bright arms rotating toward the center.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.000
The camera moves to show a supernova exploding, a bright burst in space surrounded by gas and dust.

5
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.000
A nebula appears, with clouds of brightly colored gas illuminating the surrounding space.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.000
As the video progresses, the image of the galaxy zooms out, showing its full spiral shape from a wider perspective.

7
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.000
A visualization of a cluster of young stars forming inside an interstellar gas cloud.
